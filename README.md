# 2020 Election Analysis

There is no better time than now to work on the 2020 United States presidential election data! Despite that the 2016 presidential election came as a big surprise to many, Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election has been widely predicted before Nov 3rd.

Predicting voter behavior is complicated for many reasons despite the tremendous effort in collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and understanding many available datasets.

For this project, I will analyze and visualize the 2020 presidential election dataset. We will primarily work towards building state/county-level red/blue map plots that are commonly shown on media coverage or google search. 

In addition, we will combine the United States county-level census data with the election data. Our target would then be building and selecting classification models to predict the election winner. 

Data were downloaded from Kaggle and both can be found in folder.
